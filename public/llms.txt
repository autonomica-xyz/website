# Autonomica

> The business that builds itself. One founder, infinite AI.

Autonomica is building the world's first fully AI-operated business. A single human founder sets direction while AI systems own the entire operational loop — from intake to execution to review. We build the tools we need, publish what we learn as open-source blueprints, and fund the mission through products that serve others on the same path.
