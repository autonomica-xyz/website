# The four phases of going autonomous

There's no playbook for building an autonomous company. Nobody's done it. So we made one up and we're going to see what happens.

The plan has four phases. We're in the first one.

## Phase 1: Foundation

This is where we are now. We're building the core AI systems, shipping initial products, and using the revenue to fund everything that comes next. The founder still makes most decisions. AI handles execution.

The goal here isn't autonomy yet. It's building the infrastructure that makes autonomy possible later.

## Phase 2: Automation

This is where it gets interesting. We start handing over operational responsibilities to AI systems, one department at a time. Customer support, content, financial operations, product decisions. Each handoff is an experiment: does the AI maintain quality? Where does it break? What does it need that we didn't anticipate?

We expect a lot of failures in this phase. That's the point.

## Phase 3: Autonomy

The founder steps back to strategic oversight only. AI systems run day-to-day operations end to end. The human sets direction, the machines figure out how to get there.

This is the phase we're most uncertain about. We don't know if current AI can handle this level of responsibility. Maybe it can't. Maybe it needs architectural patterns nobody's invented yet. We'll find out.

## Phase 4: Replication

If we get here, we publish the whole blueprint. Every system, every configuration, every mistake. The goal is to make it possible for anyone to spin up an autonomous company using what we've learned.

This is the phase that justifies the experiment. One autonomous company is a curiosity. A thousand of them is a new way of doing business.

## Where we actually are

We're deep in Phase 1. The products are real, the revenue targets are real, and most of the AI integration is still ahead of us. We'll write about each transition as it happens.
