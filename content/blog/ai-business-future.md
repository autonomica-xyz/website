# AI in business is mostly boring (and that's fine)

There's a version of the AI-in-business story that goes like this: AI will revolutionize everything, automate all jobs, and companies that don't adopt it will die. That version gets clicks but isn't particularly useful.

The reality is more mundane. Most businesses using AI today are doing pretty ordinary things with it. Sorting emails. Drafting first passes of documents. Answering common customer questions. Pulling numbers out of PDFs. None of this makes headlines, but it saves people hours every week.

## What's actually working

The AI applications that deliver consistent value tend to be boring:

- Classifying and routing support tickets so the right person sees them faster
- Generating first drafts that a human then edits (reports, emails, documentation)
- Monitoring systems and flagging anomalies before they become incidents
- Extracting structured data from messy inputs (invoices, forms, contracts)

These aren't glamorous. They're useful. There's a difference.

## What's mostly hype (for now)

"AI strategy" and "AI-driven decision making" are real concepts but they're ahead of where most organizations actually are. If your company still has people manually copying data between spreadsheets, you don't need an AI strategy. You need to fix the spreadsheets first.

The companies getting the most value from AI started with a specific, well-scoped problem. Not "transform our business" but "reduce the time it takes to process a return from 20 minutes to 2 minutes."

## Where it gets interesting

The piece that does feel genuinely new is AI agents that can chain multiple steps together. Not "answer this question" but "look at this queue, figure out what needs to happen, do it, and tell me what you did." We're building systems like this at Autonomica, and the gap between "impressive demo" and "reliable production system" is still wide.

The reliability problem is the real bottleneck. An agent that works 90% of the time sounds good until you realize that means it fails on every tenth task. For a business running hundreds of tasks a day, that's dozens of failures that need human cleanup.

## Our take

We're building toward fully autonomous operations, which means we care about the boring stuff as much as the flashy stuff. Probably more. An autonomous company can't have humans catching edge cases. The boring automation has to actually work, every time, at every step.

That's a harder problem than most people think. And it's what we're spending most of our time on.

## Getting started if you're thinking about this

A few things that actually help if you're exploring AI for your business:

- Start with a specific, small problem. Not "implement AI" but "speed up invoice processing"
- Measure before and after. If you can't measure the improvement, you can't tell if it's working
- Don't automate broken processes. Fix the process first, then automate it
- Budget for the iteration. The first version won't be right. Plan for three attempts
- Current models improve fast. Something that didn't work six months ago might work now
