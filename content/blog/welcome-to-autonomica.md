# Welcome to Autonomica

Autonomica is an experiment disguised as a company. Or a company disguised as an experiment. We're still figuring that part out.

The premise is simple: one human founder, zero human employees. Every operational function handled by AI systems. Not chatbots answering tickets, but AI that actually runs things. Strategy, execution, product development, all of it.

If that sounds ambitious to the point of absurdity, good. It probably is. But the only way to find out where the limits are is to push into them.

## What we're actually building

We need tools to make this work, and those tools don't exist yet. So we're building them:

- An agent management suite for deploying and configuring AI agents at scale
- A knowledge management platform that gives agents the context they need (context files, RAG pipelines, MCP integrations)
- Open source blueprints for autonomous operations, plus a marketplace for AI agent configurations

Each of these exists because we hit a wall and had to build our way through it. If they're useful to us, they're probably useful to other people too.

## Why publish any of this

We could do this quietly. But the whole point is to figure out whether autonomous business actually works, and that's more valuable as a shared finding than a trade secret.

Everything we learn gets documented. The wins, the dead ends, the stuff that looked smart until it wasn't. Subscribe if you want to follow along.
