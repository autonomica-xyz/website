# Welcome to Autonomica

We're excited to introduce Autonomica, an experimental company building tools, blueprints, and products to create the world's first fully AI-operated business.

## Our Vision

At Autonomica, we believe that the future of business is autonomous. We're pioneering a revolutionary business model: a company run by a single human founder with all other operations handled by advanced AI systems.

This isn't just automation—it's true autonomy, where AI makes decisions, executes strategies, and drives growth with minimal human intervention.

## What We're Building

While working toward our vision of a fully autonomous company, we're creating valuable AI-powered products:

1. **AI Operations Suite**: Agent management suite to easily deploy agents and tweak their configuration.
2. **Knowledgable Agents**: Knowledge management platform for AI applications, from context files to rag and mcp.
3. **Blueprints and Marketplace**: Open source blueprints on everything from incorporation to management and marketplace for AI employees.

## Join Us

We're at the beginning of an exciting journey, and we invite you to join us. Subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated on our progress and get early access to our products.
